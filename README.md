In this challenge, I analyze analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings based on  2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. I use html and Javascript.
